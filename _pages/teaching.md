#### <span style="color:#d0d0d0">2025 1st semester</span>

##### **Data Structures and Algorithm** `EEE2020-03`
In this course, we explore key data structures and algorithms (DSA) using the C++ language. Data structures and algorithms are fundamental building blocks that teach you how to solve complex problems efficiently and write optimized code. They are essential to improve your programming skills and crucial for technical interviews at top tech companies.
The curriculum starts with an introduction to C and C++ programming, including arrays, pointers, structures, and classes. We then cover various data structures, including array lists, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, hash tables, and graphs. Additionally, we discuss important algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and shortest path problems.

##### **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** `GEV6101-01`
Introductory lecture for students of graduate school of engineering.

##### **Interdisciplinary AI Engineering** `ENG3406-01`
Team teaching lecture for undergraduate students.
